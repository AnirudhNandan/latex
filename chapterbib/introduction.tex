\chapter{Introduction}
To make this document work, you have to
\begin{itemize}
\item run \verb+pdflatex+ on the main file
\item run \BibTeX\ on each of the \verb+.aux+ files generated for each chapter.
\item run \verb+pdflatex+ on the main file
\item run \verb+pdflatex+ on the main file
\end{itemize}
run \BibTeX on each of the \verb+.aux+ files generated for each chapter.
I did this with this the tiny bash script shown below, which does call \BibTeX for each of the \verb+.aux+ files found in the directory it's run in.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
pdflatex main
for i in `ls *.aux`; do bibtex $i; done
pdflatex main
pdflatex main
\end{lstlisting}
