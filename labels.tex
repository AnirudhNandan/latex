\begin{labels}
Here is the first label

Here is another, separated by an empty line

Here is the third label

This label should be on the next line, because we specified a \(3\times7\) layout.

This label is very very long, and should thus wrap in the space alloted to one label. We can also introduce linebreaks \\ by adding \verb+\\+ somewhere.

Here's the next label

Here's the last label, because it's now time to stop
