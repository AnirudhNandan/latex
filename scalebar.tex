% This document can be used to put scalebars on figures. without doing any
% calculations. Needs 'scalebar.m' (and MATLAB) and 'scalebarimage.jpg', which
% are also my the latex-repository on Github

%- Start MATLAB, load scalebar.m and start it.
%- The script prompts you to load an image, choose “scalebarimage.jpg” you've
%  downloaded from above.
%- The script prompts you to define the length of the scale bar you are going
%  to draw in the next step, choose the default “21 cm” for now
%- The script displays the image of my head and asks you to define a starting
%  point of the scale-bar, choose the tip of the nose
%- After that, choose the back of my head for the end of the scale-bar
%- Note the “Positions” shown in the help-dialog, these are to make sure you
%  clicked correctly and that the positions are correct.
%- copy the output in the command-line-section of MATLAB
%- paste this output into your .tex-file
%- if the .tex file and the image are in the same folder, just proceed, if not,
%  change the path to the image!
%- compile the file
% 
% Figure 1 of the document should show the exact same scale-bar you've drawn in
% MATLAB overlayed over the image and a second scale bar which shows a
% reasonable length (5cm in our case).
% You can change \def\x{100} and \def\y{100} on lines 24 and 25 of the copied
% text to position the scale bar where you'd like to have it and uncomment line
% 29 to turn off the original scale bar.
%
% Please enjoy typographically correct scale bars in the resulting pdf (47 kB)
